# What is iguama SDK project

The mission of the iguama SDK is to meet the needs of multiple loyalty programs users to use loyalty program points to purchase products on the amazon.com. When loyalty program integrates iguama SDK, it helps the loyalty program user redeem points for what you need from amazon.com 
The SDK is based on webview. The functions such as my account and UI presentation are on the mobile website. The SDK only implements user authorization, quote which includes 4 pages, such as shopping cart, payment method, place order and thank you page. Since user has the same way to purchase products on amazon.com, only if SDK can authorize user in the same way, different APPs can use the same SDK. Different APPs can be opened on the specified mobile website through the different client id, client key and other configurations. After starting up the SDK, the website can be used for a guide to go shopping on amazon.com.
